## What is this
My PokéDex is a project in which I interact with the a [pokéAPI](#pokeapi) to be able to show the pokemon and its characteristics such as type, weight, height, id and its experience.
## PokéAPI
This website provides a RESTful API interface to highly detailed objects built from thousands of lines of data related to Pokémon. We specifically cover the video game franchise. Using this website, you can consume information on Pokémon, their moves, abilities, types, egg groups and much, much more.

## Story
This project arose as an exercise in the [Javascript](https://aprendejavascript.org/) course of [JonMirCha](https://jonmircha.com/) in which he interacts with this rest type API but I had the decision to add a little more complexity to it, such as adding a pokémons search engine and showing the information of a specific one At the same time that I was doing this exercise I found the YouTube     [channel  of Salomon Sanchez](https://www.youtube.com/salomon%20sanchez) which [has a Figma course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc_Na94vlIOlqRIcnkOsTfqcrvnDPPrdM) of 11 videos in which he teaches how to make a pokédex from 0 so the design is specifically inspired in this course I have changed it a couple of things like typography, some colors and the positioning of elements and it seemed good to me to merge these two projects

## Recomendation
If you are a Developer *who has just started in this wonderful world of the web*, I invite you to create a project with this API and try to add your own complexity, just imagine the impossible and make it possible.
